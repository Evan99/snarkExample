Force Directed Graph

Creates a force directed graph using "D3.js"

The nodes in the graph are roses images, and their links are the EMD distances between their respective color histogram.
"dat.gui" was used to manipulate the graph on the go.

Though each operations will slow the graph...

See the example on which the graph was based at : http://www.delimited.io/blog/2014/6/17/force-directed-graphs-in-d3
or in the folder "Code source de l'exemple"
